---v1.0.3
--March 22, 2015
Added: Support for multiple units. When player changes unit, cheat menu will now function properly
Fixed: Second attempt at fixing the issue where menu will not show up for some users. Mod will check every 4 seconds to see if menu is visible. This will insure it always appears. Wait up to 10 seconds for menu to appear.
Fixed: Changed some more function definitions using CfgFunctions.
Known Issue: When player switches unit, old cheat attributes will still be active. This may or may not be an issue for users. Optional solution is planned.
Known Issue: Cheat menu may not work when loading a game save. Only works reliably in freshly started missions. Thank you nubmarine for pointing that out!
